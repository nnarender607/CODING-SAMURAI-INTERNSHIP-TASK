## 📊 Project 3 – Titanic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Objective:
Perform exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to understand patterns, distributions, and relationships between different features affecting passenger survival.

### Tasks Performed:
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Correlation analysis
- Insight extraction

### Key Insights:
- Female passengers had significantly higher survival rates.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Age and fare showed correlation with survival probability.

## 🤖 Project 4 – Titanic Survival Prediction (Logistic Regression)

### Objective:
Build a classification model using Logistic Regression to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

### Steps:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Train-test split
- Model training using Scikit-learn
- Model evaluation

### Model Performance:
- Accuracy: 79.88%
- Evaluated using confusion matrix and classification report.

### Feature Importance:
- Gender was the strongest predictor of survival.
- Passenger class significantly influenced survival probability.
- Age had a moderate negative impact on survival.
